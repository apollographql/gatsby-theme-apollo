<h4>Install the Apollo CLI</h4>

Ensure that `node` and `npm` are both installed, then run:

```bash
npm install --global apollo
```

This installs the CLI globally, but you can also install the CLI in your project's `devDependencies` and use it via [`npm-scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) or [`npx`](https://npm.im/npx).

<h4>Get your Graph Manager API key</h4>

[Log in to Graph Manager](https://engine.apollographql.com) and create a graph for your organization (if you haven't yet) by clicking **New Graph** in the upper right. Then go to your graph's Settings page and obtain or create a new API key in the API Keys section.

When you have your API key, add it to a `.env` file in the root directory of your project, like so:

```
ENGINE_API_KEY=service:foobar:d1rzyrmanmrZXxTTQLxghX
```

When you execute Apollo CLI commands (such as to register a schema), the CLI obtains your API key from the `.env` file and uses it to authenticate with Graph Manager. Alternatively, you can export `ENGINE_API_KEY` as an environment variable.

<h4>Create an apollo.config.js file</h4>

Also in your project's root directory, create a file named `apollo.config.js`. The Apollo CLI uses configuration options in this file during the execution of various commands.

A basic `apollo.config.js` file looks like this:

```js
// apollo.config.js
module.exports = {
  service: {
    endpoint: {
      url: "http://localhost:4000"
    }
    // OR
    localSchemaFile: './path/to/schema.graphql'
  }
};
```

To register your GraphQL server's schema with Graph Manager, the Apollo CLI needs to know how to access the schema. You can do this by providing either a `service.endpoint` object or a `service.localSchemaFile` string in `apollo.config.js`.

* If you provide an `endpoint` object, the CLI executes an introspection query on the GraphQL endpoint at the provided `url` to obtain your schema. To use this method, introspection must be enabled on your server.
* If you provide a `localSchemaFile` string, the CLI obtains your schema via the specified file path.

The [Apollo config documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/references/apollo-config/) has more details and advanced configuration options for the `apollo.config.js` format.
