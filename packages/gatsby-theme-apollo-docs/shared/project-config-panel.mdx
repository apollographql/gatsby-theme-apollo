<ExpansionPanel title="How to configure an Apollo project">

Follow these three steps to set up an Apollo project:

<h4>Install the Apollo CLI</h4>

To install the [`apollo` CLI](https://npm.im/apollo), ensure that `node` and `npm` are both installed, then run:

```bash
npm install --global apollo
```

**Note:** This guide will utilize the global installation method, but the `apollo` command can also be installed in a project's `devDependencies` and used via [`npm-scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) or [`npx`](https://npm.im/npx).

<h4>Get your Engine API key</h4>

To get an API key, you will need to [log in to Engine](https://engine.apollographql.com) and create a new service by clicking the "Add Service" button. If you already have a service, get your API key by visiting your service's settings page. Once you have your API key, add it to your `.env` file like so:

```
ENGINE_API_KEY=service:foobar:d1rzyrmanmrZXxTTQLxghX
```

The Apollo CLI will be looking for your `.env` file because it uses your Engine API key to authenticate with the schema registry when it pushes your schema.

**Note:** Make sure your `.env` file is in the root of your project so the Apollo CLI knows where to find it. You can also export `ENGINE_API_KEY` as an environment variable.

<h4>Create an apollo.config.js file</h4>

The commands executed through the Apollo CLI will be looking for your Apollo config to inform their behavior. To set up schema registration, you'll need to configure a source that the CLI can fetch your schema from like so:

```js
// apollo.config.js
module.exports = {
  service: {
    endpoint: {
      url: "http://localhost:4000"
    }
    // OR
    localSchemaFile: './path/to/schema.graphql'
  }
};
```

The [Apollo config documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/references/apollo-config/#clientservice) has more details and advanced configuration options for the `apollo.config.js` format.
