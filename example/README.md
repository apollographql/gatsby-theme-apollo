# Example usage of `gatsby-theme-apollo-docs`

This directory is an example project to show how you can use Apollo's docs theme for non-Apollo usage.

## Changing the logo

This also shows how to override the logo and remove the header button.

To replace the logo, add your `logo.svg` into `src/assets`. However you may need to modify the React component in `gatsby-theme-apollo-core/components/logo.js` to achieve your desired look.
